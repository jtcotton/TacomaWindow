This is generated gcode for my MakerFarm i3v 10 inch printing in either PLA or Nylon. You really don't want to use this
unless your printer has similar specs to mine.   On the off chance that you really want to use this, it was generated in 
Simplify3D for a hexagon all metal hotend.  PLA is fine for experimenting but DONT PUT IT IN YOUR TRUCK, it will melt when 
the sun comes out. Use ABS or Nylon.
