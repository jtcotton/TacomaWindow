TacomaWindow
============

Mechanism to power the sliding rear window in a Tacoma.

Project to 3d print a lead screw system that will allow for the rear window in toyota tacomas to become powered. 

I'm building this for a 2013 Tacoma DC, it might work on other model, but I'm not sure.  Feel free to pull request any changes you make to fit your truck or if you have a better design.   

The master branch has the STL files for a rack and pinion version, I do NOT suggest you use that version as it was showing some longevity issues.
