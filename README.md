TacomaWindow
============

Mechanism to power the sliding rear window in a Tacoma.

Project to 3d print a rack and pinion system that will allow for the rear window in toyota tacomas to become powered. 

The SCAD file for the rack and pinion was found here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:172508

You'll need to print these STL files, an arduino or clone (base model is fine), 2 micro switches, a continous rotation standard RC servo (40mmx20mm, not the mini servos) and 3m mounting tape or something similar that can attach Nylon to Glass. 

I'm building this for a 2013 Tacoma DC, it might work on other model, but I'm not sure.  Feel free to pull request any changes you make to fit your truck or if you have a better design.
